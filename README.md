#### Coffeemaker Nexys4 FPGA Artix-7 VHDL

Programming an automatic coffeemaker using VHDL language. This program allows the control of a coffeemaker to serve three types of coffee: short, double and long. In addition, cold, warm or hot milk can be added, as well as different levels of sugar.

The VIVADO design tool from Xilinx inc. is used, which allows us to program the Nexys4 DDR Artix-7 FPGA with its respective modules.
